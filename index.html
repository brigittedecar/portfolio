       <p style= "color:lightsteelblue">A design portfolio is used to document all of the work that goes on when an engineer invents something and carries it out. We keep one to organize our work in chronological order and to be able to patent work when needed. </p>

      <p style= "color:lightsteelblue">One day, you were living the life of a normal 13 year old girl in New Jersey. 
      Your best friend, Matt, gave you magical wishing dust for your birthday.
      After you had a very memorably bad birthday, you looked through magazines and saw the perfect life that 30 year-olds were living. Remembering that you had the magic wishing dust, you decided to make a wish to be 30.
      That night, you went to bed and woke up in a glamourous New York City apartment that you do not recognize.</p>
